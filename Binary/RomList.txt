This directory ("Binary") is part of the RomWBW System Software
distribution archive.  Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in this
directory for more information on the overall contents of the
directory.

When distributed, RomWBW contains a set of pre-built ROM images that
are ready to program onto the EEPROM of any of the Z80/Z180 based
RetroBrew Computers CPU boards.  Additionally, any custom built ROM
images will be placed in this directory.

All of the pre-built ROM images are 512KB.  This size is compatible
with all of the Z80/Z180 systems.  Some systems can accept different
size ROM images.  Creating alternative sizes requires a custom ROM
build (see ReadMe.txt in the Source directory).

It is critical that the right ROM Imgae be selected for the target
platform being used.  The table below indicates the correct ROM
image to use for each platform:

	SBC V1/V2	SBC_std.rom
	SBC SimH	SBC_simh.rom
	Zeta V1		ZETA_std.rom
	Zeta V2		ZETA2_std.rom
	N8		N8_std.rom
	Mark IV		MK4_std.rom
	RC2014 w/ Z80	RCZ80_std.rom
	RC2014 w/ Z180	RCZ180_nat.rom	(native Z180 memory addressing)
	RC2014 w/ Z180	RCZ180_ext.rom	(external 512K RAM/ROM module)
	SC-series	SC126, SC130, SC131
	Easy Z80	EZZ180_std.rom
	Dyno		DYNO_std.rom

You will find there is one additional ROM image called
"UNA_std.rom". This ROM image is an UNA-based RomWBW ROM image.  As
such, this ROM image can be used on any Z80/Z180 platform supported
by John Coffman's UNA BIOS.  Refer to RetroBrew Computers Wiki for
more information on UNA hardware support.

For each of the ROM Images (".rom"), there are corresponding files
with the extensions of ".com" and ".img".  The .com variant can be
copied to a functional RomWBW-based system and executed like a
normal application under CP/M or Z-System. This will load the new
ROM on-the-fly.  It is an excellent way to test a ROM Image before
actually burning it.  Similarly, the .img files can be loaded using
the UNA FAT loader for testing.

All of the standard ROM Images are configured for:
 - 512KB ROM Disk
 - 512KB RAM Disk
 - 38.4Kbps baud serial console (*)
 - Auto-discovery of all serial ports

* RC2014 and Stephen Cousins' kits run at 115,200Kbps baud

All hard disk type devices (IDE, PPIDE, CF Card, SD Card) will be
automatically assigned at least two drive letters per device.  The
drive letters will refer to the first 2 slices of the device. The
ASSIGN command can be used to display and reassign drives to disk
devices and slices as desired.

Standard ROM Image Notes
------------------------

The standard ROM images will detect and install support for certain
devices and peripherals that are on-board or frequently used with
each platform as documented below.  If the device or peripheral is
not detected at boot, the ROM will simply bypass support
appropriately.

SBC (SBC_std.rom):
 - CPU speed is detected at startup
 - Console on onboard UART serial port at 38400 baud
 - Includes support for PPIDE/CF Card(s) connected to on-board
   parallel port.
 - Includes support for CVDU and VGA3 boards.  If detected at
   startup, support for video and keyboard is installed
   including VT-100/ANSI terminal emulation.
 - Auto-detects PropIO or PropIO V2 and installs associated
   video, keyboard and SD Card support if present.
 - If PropIO, PropIO V2, CVDU, or VGA hardware is detected,
   initial console output is determined by JP2.  If JP2 is
   shorted, console will go to on-board serial port, if JP2
   is open, console will go to the detected video and keyboard
   ports.
 - SBC V1 has a known race condition in the bank switching
   circuit which is likely to cause system instability.  SBC
   V2 does not have this issue.

SBC (SBC_simh.rom):
 - SBC variant customized to run under SimH
 - Implments two emulated SimH hard disk images
 - Uses SimH RTC

ZETA (ZETA_std.rom):
 - CPU speed is detected at startup
 - Console on onboard UART serial port at 38400 baud
 - Includes support for on-board floppy disk controller and
   two attached floppy disks.
 - Auto-detects ParPortProp and includes support for it if it
   is attached.
 - If ParPortProp is installed, initial console output is
   determined by JP1.  If JP1 is shorted, console will go to
   on-board serial port, if JP1 is open, console will go to
   ParPortProp video and keyboard ports.

ZETA2 (ZETA2_std.rom):
 - CPU speed is detected at startup
 - Console on onboard UART serial port at 38400 baud
 - Includes support for on-board floppy disk controller and
   two attached floppy disks.
 - Auto-detects ParPortProp and includes support for it if it
   is attached.
 - Uses CTC to generate periodic timer interrupts.
 - If ParPortProp is installed, initial console output is
   determined by JP1.  If JP1 is shorted, console will go to
   on-board serial port, if JP1 is open, console will go to
   ParPortProp video and keyboard ports.

N8 (N8_std.rom):
 - CPU speed is detected at startup
 - Console on Z180 onboard primary ASCI serial port at 38400 baud
