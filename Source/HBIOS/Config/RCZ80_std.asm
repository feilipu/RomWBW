;   RC2014 Z80 STANDARD CONFIGURATION
;==================================================================================================
;
; THE COMPLETE SET OF DEFAULT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS FOR THIS PLATFORM ARE FOUND IN THE
; CFG_<PLT>.ASM INCLUDED FILE WHICH IS FOUND IN THE PARENT DIRECTORY.  THIS FILE CONTAINS
; COMMON CONFIGURATION SETTINGS THAT OVERRIDE THE DEFAULTS.  IT IS INTENDED THAT YOU MAKE
; YOUR CUSTOMIZATIONS IN THIS FILE AND JUST INHERIT ALL OTHER SETTINGS FROM THE DEFAULTS.
; EVEN BETTER, YOU CAN MAKE A COPY OF THIS FILE WITH A NAME LIKE <PLT>_XXX.ASM AND SPECIFY
; YOUR FILE IN THE BUILD PROCESS.
;
; THE SETTINGS BELOW ARE THE SETTINGS THAT ARE MOST COMMONLY MODIFIED FOR THIS PLATFORM.
; MANY OF THEM ARE EQUAL TO THE SETTINGS IN THE INCLUDED FILE, SO THEY DON'T REALLY DO
; ANYTHING AS IS.  THEY ARE LISTED HERE TO MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO ADJUST THE MOST COMMON
; SETTINGS.
;
; N.B., SINCE THE SETTINGS BELOW ARE REDEFINING VALUES ALREADY SET IN THE INCLUDED FILE,
; TASM INSISTS THAT YOU USE THE .SET OPERATOR AND NOT THE .EQU OPERATOR BELOW. ATTEMPTING
; TO REDEFINE A VALUE WITH .EQU BELOW WILL CAUSE TASM ERRORS!
;
; PLEASE REFER TO THE CUSTOM BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (README.TXT) IN THE SOURCE DIRECTORY (TWO
; DIRECTORIES ABOVE THIS ONE).
